### What is SMPTweaks?
___
Vanilla Minecraft is made for single players and it shows. When more than a handful people hop on a server, various problems arise, such as shortage of non-renewable items and (almost) unusable gameplay mechanics like sleeping.
This plugin provides various tweaks that enhance multiplayer experience and adds level system, login rewards and other nice-to-haves.

SMPTweaks is fully modular, largely async and built in a lightweight way with high player counts in mind.

### Features

---

- Server level system
- Custom death logic (Configure how much XP and what kind of items are dropped when a player dies)
- Adjustable mob spawn rates
- Prevent sleeping and modify length of night and day
- Custom global drops
- Fully Customizable Daily Login Rewards
- MySQL support
- ...and much more!

All features can be enabled or disabled individually!

### Requirements

---

- SMPTweaks supports **Spigot**, **Paper** and should work on any of their forks such as **Tuinity**, **Purpur**, etc.
- If you wish to use placeholders, you will have to install the plugin **PlaceholderAPI**
