### What is SMPTweaks?
___
Vanilla Minecraft is made for single players and it shows. When more than a handful people hop on a server, various problems arise, such as shortage of non-renewable items and gameplay mechanics becoming (almost) unusable like sleeping.
This plugin provides various tweaks and configuration options that enhance vanilla multiplayer and adds level system, login rewards and other nice-to-haves.

SMPTweaks is fully modular, largely async and built in a lightweight way with high player counts in mind.

### Requirements

---

- SMPTweaks supports **Spigot**, **Paper** and should work on any of their forks such as **Purpur**, **Airplane** etc.
- If you wish to use placeholders, you will have to install the plugin **PlaceholderAPI**
- Java 16 or higher, Minecraft version 1.17 and above
