# Do you wish to contribute a translation?
Please use the en_us.yml file as basis, copy its contents and start translating. When you're done open a pull request so we can merge it into the project. The file name of your translations should be the IETF language tag in all lowercase with a hyphen separator (eg. pt-br.yml for Brazilian Portuguese)
